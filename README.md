Let’s create a real-time clock (RTC) as an embedded system project using the 8051 microcontroller, an LCD, and a 4 keys (up - down - right - left)and 2 keys (start - stop),This project will allow us to display the current time on an LCD screen. Here’s a detailed description:
Real-Time Clock Using 8051 Microcontroller, LCD, and Keypad
Components:
8051 Microcontroller (AT89C51): The central component responsible for interfacing with other peripherals and managing the real-time clock functionality.
16x2 LCD Module: Used to display the time and date in a human-readable format.
4 keys: Allows user interaction for setting the time. 
Interfacing the 6 keys with 8051:
Connect the 4 keys to the microcontroller using appropriate port (p2).
start : start clock connect in pin (int1).
stop : stop clock connect in pin (int0).
Displaying Time on the LCD:
Initialize the 16x2 LCD module and configure it for 8-bit mode.
Continuously update the LCD display with the current time.
